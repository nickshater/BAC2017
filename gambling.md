## Bankroll Management

The most important part of educated gambling is bankroll management, there are many swings in sports betting and calculated wagering
is the most effective way to be able to continue gambling without going broke.

The first step is to determine your unit amount. For beginning gamblers this should be 2% or less of your bankroll. As you determine
you are a winning gambler you can up that to up to 5% for responsible wagering.

As you progress in skill you can move on to variable bankroll management, with this system you will wager a certain number of units
based on several factors, such as confidence level and wager value. 

## Odds

Odds are easy to pick up once you get use to them. I will go over the American odds system, because it's common amongst books and easy 
to explain. 

American odds are portrayed as an integer with a +/- sign. 

A + means that the win will be the value of the number for each $100 you bet

example: +200 would mean that if you bet $200 you would win $400.

A - means that you need to bet the value of the number to win $100

example: -200 would mean that if you bet $100 you would win $50

Point spread odds are pretty consistently between +/- 100 & +/- 130.

Moneyline odds vary widely based on how large of a favorite one team is.

To turn odds into decimal odds the formula is:

For + lines: (line / 100) + 1

example: +300 (300 / 100) + 1 = 4

For - lines: 100 / line + 1

example: -300 (100 / 300) + 1 = 1.33333

To calculate probability the formula is:

1 / decimal-odds

example: 1/4 = .25

example: 1/1.33333 = .75
